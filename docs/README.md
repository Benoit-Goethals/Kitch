# Your own documentation site

This repository builds a documentation website using sphinx. Although sphinx is
known as the tool for generating Python documentation, it can be used for any
kind of documentation.


## Conda environment

We have foreseen all the needed packages in the AMPython environment.  You can
use the am2210 or am2311 environment or any of the future versions to build the
documentation.
