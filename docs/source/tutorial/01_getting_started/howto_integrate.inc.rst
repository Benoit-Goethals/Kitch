How to integrate this in your project
=====================================

This repository serves as a starting point to create your own documentation.
After it has been cloned, you should place the directory under
**<your_project_root>\\docs** and remove the .git folder. At that moment, it
becomes part of your project, without link to the original repository.

Later in this tutorial, we go further into details on this topic when we
discuss a possible project structure for a well-structured Python project.


.. note::

    We suppose at this moment that all projects where this will be used, are
    Python projects. But it could serve to other programming languages as well.
